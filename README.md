My solutions for the Hash Code 2020 in Python 3

Here are my solutions of Hash Code 2020 Extended Round. I got top 44 with "TnT" Team with 27,109,258 points.

I used Python because I think Python is easier to understand that other languages and because you code less lines, it is not the fastest language, but its fast enough to pass the time limit in the contests
